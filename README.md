# File Sorter(cmd version) V1.0

Greetings. This is a file sorter project. It was created by me because I, 
like many people, am often too lazy to sort files from the downloads folder. 
This program is designed to help you sort folders by file type and folder type. Inside there is a dictionary
in which the key is the name of the folder (if such a folder does not exist, it will be created by the program) and the values are the type of files. 
You can change this dictionary to your liking. Do not forget about the boolean value "DUPLICATE" - this value determines the check during sorting, 
it often happens that the file already exists in the folder, and if the value is True, the text will be added to the file that this is a duplicate, 
if the value is False - the file in the folder will be replaced by the one that is transferred. I created this project because 
I did not find worthy alternatives. And why do you need alternatives if you can write your own program and, if necessary, rewrite it! 
In the future I will publish a version of this program only with a visual interface. 
I will be glad to your advice. The main condition is to use only standard python libraries. Thank you!
